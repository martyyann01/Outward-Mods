# Stackable Peacemaker

This mods intends to make the Peacemaker Elixir (passive skill) stack if you consume another Peacemaker Elixir (item) obtained when finishing the main quest. 

Would be compatible with : 
- the NewGamePlus mod by @random-facades (link here : https://github.com/random-facades/Outward-Mods/tree/main/NewGamePlus)
- being given another Peacemaker Elixir by someone in multiplayer
